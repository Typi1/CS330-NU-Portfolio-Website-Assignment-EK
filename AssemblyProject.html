                    <p>
                        For my final project in the class "Fundamentals of Computer System Software" (COMP_ENG 205 at Northwestern University),
                        I used the MASM assembly programming language to create a game where the player controls a spaceship 
                        fighting a boss while dodging their attacks. In the following sections, I describe the controls, objective, 
                        and mechanics of the game.
                    </p>
                </div>
                
            </section>
            <section aria-labelledby="game-contr">
                <h3 id="game-contr">Controls</h3>
                <div class="proj-text-wrapper">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rotate the spaceship with the left and right arrow keys.</li> 
                        <li>Move forwards or backwards depending on what way the spaceship is facing with the up and down arrow keys.</li>
                        <li>If you have a laser powerup (indicated by the hearts in the bottom right corner being blue), press spacebar to fire a powerful laser in front of the spaceship that continues to shoot while you move. 
                            <ul><li>Note that after firing the laser, a powerup must be collected to use it again. Not having the laser usable is indicated by the hearts in the bottom right corner being red.</li></ul></li>
                        <li>Press/hold E to shoot bullet projectiles in front of the spaceship.</li>
                        <li>Press Q to pause/unpause the game.</li>
                        <li>Press P while the player's laser is being fired to see the hitboxes used to calculate collision with it.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>In the top-left corner, various icons will appear.
                            <ul>
                                <li>The most top-left icon indicates that you have been hit and you will be invincible for as long as it is displayed (not long).</li>
                                <li>The icon below that indicates that your bullet projectiles have hit the enemy.</li>
                                <li>The icon to the right of that indicates that your laser has hit the enemy.</li>
                                <li>Note that these icons disappear when the conditions that make them appear become unsatisfied.</li>
                            
                            </ul></li>
                        <li>When you have been hit and you health is now represented by an odd number of hearts, a powerup will appear in the top region of the screen.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Collect this powerup to regain a charge of the laser ability. Note that only 1 can be stored at a time.</li>
                                <li>Additionally, powerups will not spawn during the 4th phase, though if one spawned in a previous phase and wasn't collected, it will still be there.</li>
                            </ul></li>
                        <li>If you game over or clear the game and want to play again, relaunch the .exe file.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="proj-text-wrapper">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Defeat the enemy in the center of the screen by damaging it by hitting it with the bullet projectiles and player's laser.</li>
                        <li>Be mindful not to run out of health, indicated by the hearts in the bottom right corner. You can be damaged by getting hit by the enemy's laser or bullet projectiles.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Note that you won't get hurt by touching the enemy itself.</li>
                                <li>Running out of health results in a game over and you must restart by relaunching the .exe file.</li>
                            </ul></li>
                        <li>The enemy has four phases:
                            <ol type="1">
                                <li>A rigid pattern of vertical and horizontal lasers appear onscreen. A brief look at where the lasers will fire will appear before the laser hitboxes are active so you can avoid them.</li>
                                <li>The enemy will fire its bullet projectiles in 4 directions at once and slowly rotate its aim for all of them.</li>
                                <li>The enemy does mostly the same behavior as in phase 2 but its rotation arc is wider and it rotates quicker.</li>
                                <li>Phases 1 and 2 occur simultaneously.</li>
                            </ol></li>
                        <li>You can tell that a phase change has occurred by the change in attack patterns and the enemy's appearance changing.</li>
                    </ul>
